/*
Lets say you want to create a function that has access to data that
persists even after the function exits. For example, you want to count how many
times the function has been called, or you want to create a fibonacci number generator,
but you don’t want anyone else to have access to that
 data (so they can’t accidentally change it). You can use closures to achieve this.
